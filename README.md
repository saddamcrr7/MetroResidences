Responsive single landing page
We have a fully designed (with prototype) landing page. The page needs to built as a full standalone page.

As the page is standalone there is no need to integrated into any backend systems. The page contains a simple contact form at the bottom with a dual calendar picker (start and end date)

The page design requires experience in building web pages that heavily utilises animation and transitions.

Expected output is a fully responsive (desktop, tablet & mobile) landing page.

Animations and transitions are expected to function on all devices.

Documentation and examples will be given once agreement has been made
